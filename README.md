# Tweet-Feeds-Collection
Python Scripts to collect data from Twitter &amp; Facebook social media.
This project is developed using Python as the programming language in its most scripting -functional way. 
Using twitter and facebook API's modules and oauth credentials (twitter mainly) we collect the data which is dumped to local 
files.
The methods or calls can be used in any code without any dependancy.
